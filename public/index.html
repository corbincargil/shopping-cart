      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      QUESTIONS: 

      1) In the ProductNavigation.js component, browsing by product/brand on the Shop page was done by taking the complete array of products and filtering  it based on the brand or product type (information contained in the the products.js file in the 'util' folder). An alternative could have been to make a page for each brand or product type and each listed product type or brand would have linked to its own page. Is one way better than the other? Obviously there are many different ways this could have been done. Also was my use of the useEffect hook (and additional functions in the ProductNavigation component) alright or is there I way I could have done it more efficiently? 

      2) This was the first time I used react router for a project. It functions the way I wanted it to, but is the way that I implemented it the best practice? My goal was to keep the header and footer on each page, but depending on the URL have different page content in the middle. I imagine this is a pretty common way to setup a website, so I bet theres a better way to do it other than the way I did, using the Layout.js compoenent I made. 

      3)
